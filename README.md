DOS tools to build graphical layout.

This code was just uploaded as a kind of backup.
The code was written in Assembler (TASM) as I was jung has enought time and hairs on my head. This was 1992 ;-)

The idea was to design a graphical layout to palace multiple frames on your sreen. I bi like the Norton Tools ;-)
There are a lot of spelling issues in the comments, however I leave them in to to keep the originaly of the code.
